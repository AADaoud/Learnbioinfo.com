**Bioinformatics** is an interdisciplinary field that is aimed at the development of *methods*, *algorithms*, and other techniques through which biological data such as *genomes* and *proteomes* can be better understood by researchers. It suffers however from an inherent issue; that being the lack of sufficient resources online through which it can be learned.

**Learnbioinfo.com** is an opensource website aimed at simplifying the learning process of bioinformatics through the accumulation of knowledge into a *single*, *coherent*, and *easily-accessible* body; a one-stop shop for all your bioinformatics needs.

It has been developed by Abdullah Daoud, a university student studying medicine in Istanbul at Acıbadem University. In that regards, the website is based on the "Bioinformatics" course given by Acıbadem University.
