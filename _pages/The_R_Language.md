R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. Created by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, R is used among data miners, bioinformaticians and statisticians for data analysis and developing statistical software. 

Within the scope of this website, it is important to understand that the R language is used extensively in the fields of biostatistics and bioinformatics, and is a very powerful tool for the integration of data science into healthcare.
