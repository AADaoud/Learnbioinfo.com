# Characteristics of amino acids:
## Glycine:
A special amino acid which allows for flexibility in the polypeptide chain.
![[Amino acids#Glycine]]

## Tryptophan:
Tryptophan regulates the size of molecules that can pass through [[Proteins|protein]] channels.
![[Amino acids#Tryptophan]]
Tryptophan is also useful in the process of [[Antigens|antigen]] uptake, and is considered to be the most **conserved** amino acid in any polypeptide chain (i.e. the body does not want it to mutate because its detrimental and would cause any molecule to go through the protein channel for example).

Tryptophan also functions as a structural component of proteins, and when it is gone (example replaced with glycine, in which case it results in a vacuum), it results in deadly mutations.

# Algorithms:
## Sequence alignment:
The dynamic programming algorithm is used to create sequence alignments. Dynamic programming ensures that optimum solutions are always achieved.

Concept of dynamic programming:
