# Fragment assembly:
How do you assemble overlapping fragments of DNA to get a correct sequence?
1. Enumerate the overlaps
2. Turn it into a graph of potential paths (drawing an arrow with the number of overlapping bases).
3. Ensure a pathway is drawn connecting all the overlaps with the highest possible weight (number of overlapping bases).
4. Assemble the bases according to the pathway.

Complexity of the operation is: 

$complexity = (fragments)!$

Thus, efficient pathways are needed.

How to determine the gene sequences and diagnose mutations?
Approx. 100,000 [[Proteins|proteins]] in a human; but only 20,000 genes (scientists thought each gene was responsible for 1 protein, however it was 5 proteins due to gene-splicing).

CG islands, ATG and TATA-box sequences where used to as gene start signals (CG islands could also be stop codons), and TAA-TGA-TAG where used for stop codons.

# Epigenetics:
Methylation patterns were discovered through the contrasting worker and queen bees. How can queen and worker bees differ when they had **the exact** same gene sequence. The answer was the methylation of [[Cytosine|cytosine]] bases on CG islands, blocking TF from expressing certain genes.

[[Nicotine]] is one of the most effective agents in mutating your [[DNA]] promoters, inhibiting TF binding and transcription.

Pseudogene: Loss of the start codon (deadly mutation), loss of the stop codon is also a deadly mutation.

Hydrophobic to charged mutations are more severe than hydrophobic to polar mutations, however they are both still bad.

Charged to polar, and polar to charged are acceptable mutations (i.e. not deadly).

Questions asked in the test will ask how a certain mutation in a protein might have occurred, the answer will focus on comparing the most statistically likely codon to have mutated to cause this new protein.

Other questions might ask what codons are most likely to form a stop codon or something after some mutation (can be single point).
