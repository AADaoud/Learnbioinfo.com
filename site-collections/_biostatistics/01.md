"There are lies, damned lies, and statistics" is a phrase popularized by the writer Mark Twain.

In an increasingly digital world, we record, save, upload, and share all the details of our lives. Never has the flow of data been so unobstructed, and with continual developments in technology, it is certain that the future will only remove barriers preventing the total and complete free-flow of information.
