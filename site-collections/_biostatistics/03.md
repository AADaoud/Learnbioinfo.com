What do height, birth weight, IQ, the income distribution in a particular country, and your performance in school have in common? They are all normally distributed values that we see in the real world.

The normal distribution gives biostatisticians an insight into the position of any value in the real world in terms of its likelihood, and it informs us that the values which are closer to the mean are more likely than values which are farther away from the mean, giving us the characteristic "bell-shape curve".

In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and a line drawn at the center of the curve covers all three metrics, which is why they are collectively termed as the mean. Apart from the mean, the determination of any normal distribution is also contingent upon knowing the variance as well, with these two metrics any normal curve is written as follows:

$$X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$$

Using this notation, we describe that: dataset $X$ is normally distributed ($N$) with a mean of $\mu$ and a variance of $\sigma^2$.

## The Standard Normal Distribution
Within biostatistics, there is the standard normal distribution which is described as $X\sim N(0,1)$. This standard normal distribution is usually denoted with Z, a convention that signifies its standardization with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is the cornerstone of one-sample hypothesis testing.

### Standardization of Curves
The standardization of curves is a relatively straightforward process that uses the following formula

$$ Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} $$

Where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation that can be determined by just square rooting the variance.

$$ \sigma=\sqrt{\sigma^2} $$

You can use this formula to determine the areas under any normally distributed curve by standardizing a value from the non-standard normal distribution to the standard normal distribution then determining the area under the curve from a standard normal table or z-table[^1].

### Null and Alternative Hypothesis
The actual test begins by considering two hypotheses. They are called the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. These hypotheses contain opposing viewpoints.

**The null hypothesis** ($H_0$): It is a statement of no difference, no effect, or no correlation, depending on the context. In other words, the difference equals zero. This can often be considered the status quo and as a result if you cannot accept the null it requires some action.

**The alternative hypothesis** ($H_a$): It is a claim about the population that is contradictory to $H_0$ and what we conclude when we cannot accept $H_0$. The alternative hypothesis is the contender and must win with considerable evidence to overthrow

the status quo. This concept is sometimes referred to the tyranny of the status quo because as we will see later, to overthrow the null hypothesis takes usually ninety or greater confidence that this is the proper decision.

Since the null and alternative hypotheses are contradictory, you must examine evidence to decide if you have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not. The evidence is in the form of sample data.

After you have determined which hypothesis the sample supports, you make a decision. There are two options for a decision. They are "cannot accept $H_0$" if the sample information favors the alternative hypothesis or "fail to reject $H_0$" if the sample information is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis. These conclusions are all based upon a level of probability, a significance level, which is set by the analyst.

### Type I and Type II errors
When you perform a hypothesis test, there are four outcomes depending on the actual truth (or falseness) of the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the decision to reject or not. The outcomes are as shown below.

|             | **Decision**                                      |
| **${H_0}$** | Fail to Reject          | Reject                  |
| **True**    | Correct decision        | Type I error ($\alpha$) |
| **False**   | Type II error ($\beta$) | Correct decision        |

The four possible outcomes in the table are:

1. The decision is cannot reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true (correct decision).
2. The decision is cannot accept $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true (incorrect decision known as a Type I error). This case is described as “rejecting a good null”. As we will see later, it is this type of error that we will guard against by setting the probability of making such an error. The goal is to NOT take an action that is an error.
3. The decision is cannot reject $H_0$ when, in fact, $H_0$ is false (incorrect decision known as a Type II error). This is called “accepting a false null”. In this situation you have allowed the status quo to remain in force when it should be overturned. As we will see, the null hypothesis has the advantage in competition with the alternative.
4. The decision is cannot accept $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false (correct decision).
Each of the errors occurs with a particular probability. The Greek letters α and β represent the probabilities.

$\alpha$ = probability of a Type I error = **P(Type I error)** = probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true: rejecting a good null.

$\beta$ = probability of a Type II error = **P(Type II error)** = probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false. ($1 − \beta$) is called the 'Power of the Test'.

$\alpha$ and $\beta$ should be as small as possible because they are probabilities of errors.

Statistics allows us to set the probability that we are making a Type  I error.  The probability of making a Type  I error is $\alpha$. Recall that the confidence intervals in the last unit were set by choosing a value called $Z_\alpha$ (or $t_\alpha$) and the $\alpha$ value determined the confidence level of the estimate because it was the probability of the interval failing to capture the true mean (or proportion parameter p). This $\alpha$ and that one are the same.

# One Sample T-test
A one sample T-test is conducted to by first determining a null and alternative hypothesis about the mean of a sample, then an appropriate confidence level must be chosen to decide when to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis, after that a test statistic (t) must be calculated using the formula below.

$$ Test \ Statistic \ (t)=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} $$

Once the test statistic is determined it can be used to determine a p-value (also known as a critical value) which informs us where the mean of the sample in question lies relative to its probability of occurring in the original population. For most general applications a critical value of 0.05 is used. The decision based on the p-value is as follows

- If the calculated test statistic is larger than the critical value, then we fail to reject $H_0$.
- If the calculated test statistic however is smaller than the critical value, then we can reject $H_0$ with our predetermined confidence level (95% for critical value of 0.05) and instead accept $H_\alpha$

## In a nutshell, how to conduct a hypothesis test?
A systematic approach to hypothesis testing follows the following steps and in this order. This template will work for all hypotheses that you will ever test.

Set up the null and alternative hypothesis. This is typically the hardest part of the process. Here the question being asked is reviewed. What parameter is being tested, a mean, a proportion, differences in means, etc. Is this a one-tailed test or two-tailed test? Remember, if someone is making a claim it will always be a one-tailed test.
Decide the level of significance required for this case and determine the critical value. These can be found in the appropriate statistical table. The levels of confidence typical for the social sciences are 90, 95 and 99. However, the level of significance is a policy decision and should be based upon the risk of making a Type I error, rejecting a good null. Consider the consequences of making a Type I error.
Next, based on the hypotheses and sample size, select the appropriate test statistic and find the relevant critical value: $Z_\alpha$, $t_\alpha$, etc. Drawing the relevant probability distribution and marking the critical value is always helpful. Be sure to match the graph with the hypothesis, especially if it is a one-tailed test.

- Take a sample(s) and calculate the relevant parameters: sample mean, standard deviation, or proportion. Using the formula for the test statistic from above, now calculate the test statistic for this case using the parameters you have just calculated.
- Compare the calculated test statistic and the critical value. Marking these on the graph will give a good visual picture of the situation. There are now only two situations:

a.     The test statistic is in the tail: Cannot Accept the null, the probability that this sample mean (proportion) came from the hypothesized distribution is too small to believe that it is the real home of these sample data.

b.   The test statistic is not in the tail: Cannot Reject the null, the sample data are compatible with the hypothesized population parameter.

- Reach a conclusion. It is best to articulate the conclusion two different ways. First a formal statistical conclusion such as “With a 95 % level of significance we cannot accept the null hypotheses that the population mean is equal to XX (units of measurement)”. The second statement of the conclusion is less formal and states the action, or lack of action, required. If the formal conclusion was that above, then the informal one might be, “The machine is broken, and we need to shut it down and call for repairs”.

All hypotheses tested will go through this same process. The only changes are the relevant formulas and those are determined by the hypothesis required to answer the original question.
