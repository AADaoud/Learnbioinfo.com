| *The field of modern mathematical statistics was started by the mathematician and biostatistician Karl Pearson.* |

The field of biostastics is a multi-disciplinary field that applies statistical concepts in the field of biology and medicine. The main driving concepts of biostatistics are the collection, storage, and analysis of data followed by the extraction of meaningful observations that can aid us in improving pre-existing systems.

As medical students, it is important to arm ourselves with these tools and to understand how to use them effectively in our daily lives to make better decisions faster, especially in times when every second and every step can be the difference between life and death.

That is why this course is designed to teach you all the relevant statistical techniques while simultaneously presenting you with relevant, real-world examples to aid in maturing your understanding of the concepts. Sometimes it is rather difficult to comprehend advanced theoretical concepts without appropriate visualizations and thought experiments to ground examples to the real world; this course attempts to avoid such issues as much as possible.

The field of statistics is mainly divided into two main categories: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Both categories of statistics are integral to the process of understanding and explaining data, and the main differences between them include:
- Descriptive statistics aims at getting a quick overview of certain characteristics for any particular set of data, including mean/median/mode calculations, measuring variations/deviations, and understanding more macro level observations such as data skewness.
- Inferential statistics is concerned with the inference of larger trends about populations from the observations taken from smaller samples. For that reason it is important in inferential statistics to be certain that the sample represents the larger population perfectly; of course, we do not live in an ideal world and so no sample is a perfect representation of the population, thus we often utilize certain sampling techniques (cite?), and significance tests to make calculations in statistics more rigorous.

## Terminology & Notation:
Before going further with elucidating any of the concepts relvant to both descriptive and inferential statistics, it is important to define the relevant terminology and notations.

### Sample Vs. Population
Statisticians dream of an experiment where their sample is the population, this is because despite the mathematical complexity we may often associate with statistics, it is really only so complex because of the issues faced when assuming that a sample of individuals or animals is a perfect representation of the whole population.

Since samples are in fact not perfect representations of the whole population, we must be very specific in our calculations to ensure that we always use proper notation.

### Notation:

|            | Sample Statistic | Population Parameter |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Size       | *n*                 | **N**                    |
| Mean       | 
| Variance   |
| Std Dev.   |
| Proportion |

$$ y = x^2 $$
