| *The field of modern mathematical statistics was founded by the mathematician and biostatistician Karl Pearson.* |

The field of biostastics is a multi-disciplinary field that applies statistical concepts in the field of biology and medicine. The main driving concepts of biostatistics are the collection, storage, and analysis of data followed by the extraction of meaningful observations that can aid us in improving pre-existing systems.

As medical students, it is important to arm ourselves with these tools and to understand how to use them effectively in our daily lives to make better decisions faster, especially in times when every second and every step can be the difference between life and death.

That is why this course is designed to teach you all the relevant statistical techniques while simultaneously presenting you with relevant, real-world examples to aid in maturing your understanding of the concepts. Sometimes it is rather difficult to comprehend advanced theoretical concepts without appropriate visualizations and thought experiments to ground examples to the real world; this course attempts to avoid such issues as much as possible.

# Remember Math Class?

The field of statistics is mainly divided into two main categories: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Both categories of statistics are integral to the process of understanding and explaining data, and the main differences between them include:
- Descriptive statistics aims at getting a quick overview of certain characteristics for any particular set of data, including mean/median/mode calculations, measuring variations/deviations, and understanding more macro level observations such as data skewness.
- Inferential statistics is concerned with the inference of larger trends about populations from the observations taken from smaller samples. For that reason it is important in inferential statistics to be certain that the sample represents the larger population perfectly; of course, we do not live in an ideal world and so no sample is a perfect representation of the population, thus we often utilize certain sampling techniques (cite?), and significance tests to make calculations in statistics more rigorous.

## Terminology & Notation
Before going further with elucidating any of the concepts relvant to both descriptive and inferential statistics, it is important to define the relevant terminology and notations.

### Sample Vs. Population
Statisticians dream of an experiment where their sample is the population, this is because despite the mathematical complexity we may often associate with statistics, it is really only so complex because of the issues faced when assuming that a sample of individuals or animals is a perfect representation of the whole population.

Since samples are in fact not perfect representations of the whole population, we must be very specific in our calculations to ensure that we always use proper notation.

The notations used in statistics are different depending on wether we are speaking about the sample or the population, the table below summarizes the different notations used for both samples and populations:

|            | Sample Statistic                                           | Population Parameter                               |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Size       | $ n $                                                      | $ N $                                              |
| Mean       | $ \overline{x} = \frac{\Sigma{x}}{n} $                     | $ \mu = \frac{\Sigma{X}}{N} $                      |
| Variance   | $ s^2 = \frac{\Sigma{(x-\overline{x})^2}}{n-1} $           | $ \sigma^2 = \frac{\Sigma{(X-\mu)^2}}{N} $         |
| Standard Deviation   | $ s = \sqrt{s^2} $                               | $ \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} $                       |
| Proportion | $ \hat{p} = \frac{n \  of \  successes}{n \ of \ trials} $ | $ p = \frac{N \ of \ successes}{N \ of \ trials} $ |

The use of statistics in Japan was not widespread throughout much of the early 20th century, and during the Second World War as well, however that would all change with the establishment of the 'Quality Control Research Group' by the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers[^1].

Following the end of the Second World War and the adoption of the 1947 institution, the Japanese economy was capable of adapting itself to the new world in such a stunning fashion due to a multitude of reasons, one of these reasons included the stastistical literacy rates amongst its populations, with anywhere from 92-99 percent of the Japanese working population had an elementary understanding of the 'Seven Basic Tools of Quality'[^2].

Dr. Kauro Ishikawa recalled from past experience that the solution to 95 percent of any company's problems can be discovered using these seven simple, yet extremely powerful tools which he described. Some of these tools include the histogram, the scatter diagram, and flow charts. The fact that literacy in these elementary statistical techniques was so widespread amongst the general population of Japan following the war may have played a key role in propelling the Japanese economy to its current gargantuan status.

It is these examples that help to show us the real and deterministic advantages we gain once we develop a better understanding of the field of statistics, thus let us discover the elementary statistical tools used in biostatistics, their characteristics, uses, and their overall contributions to the field of medicine.

### The Variable
There is nothing as elementary in statistics than understanding the variable. The variable can be thought of as any singular category which is observed and used to determine values that we can deduce observations from. Variables are mainly divided into two types: qualitative and quantitative variables.
- A qualitative variable is a variable which is measured in a discrete manner and is not numerical. Further sub-classifications include nominal (no particular order), binary (presnet/absent, agree/disagree), ordinal (has a natural order negative/neutral/positive), and counted variables (counted but non-quantitative variables).
- A quantitative variable is a variable which is physically measured and is a quantifiable value (i.e., can be expressed as a number). Quantitative variables can be interval (all real numbers used in measurement), or ratio variables (expressed as positive numbers, with 0 indicating none)

### The Six Basic Graphics of Biostatistics

Similarly to the 'Seven Basic Tools of Quality' described by Dr. Kauro Ishikawa, within the field of biostatistics specifically there are six basic graphics that students must learn before attempting to learn any further concepts. These so called 'Six Basic Graphics of Biostatistics' are:

- Frequency tables
- Bar charts
- Contingency tables
- Histograms
- Box plots
- Scatter plots

#### Frequency Tables

| Pet               | Frequency (Number) |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Cats              | 23                 |
| Dogs              | 24                 |
| Peregrine Falcons | 1                  |
