| *The field of modern mathematical statistics was founded by the mathematician and biostatistician Karl Pearson.* |

The field of biostatistics is a multi-disciplinary field that applies statistical concepts in the field of biology and medicine. The main driving concepts of biostatistics are the collection, storage, and analysis of data followed by the extraction of meaningful observations that can aid us in improving pre-existing systems.

As medical students, it is important to arm ourselves with these tools and to understand how to use them effectively in our daily lives to make better decisions faster, especially in times when every second and every step can be the difference between life and death.

That is why this course is designed to teach you all the relevant statistical techniques while simultaneously presenting you with relevant, real-world examples to aid in maturing your understanding of the concepts. Sometimes it is rather difficult to comprehend advanced theoretical concepts without appropriate visualizations and thought experiments to ground examples to the real world; this course attempts to avoid such issues as much as possible.

# Remember Math Class?

The field of statistics is mainly divided into two main categories: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Both categories of statistics are integral to the process of understanding and explaining data, and the main differences between them include:
- Descriptive statistics aims at getting a quick overview of certain characteristics for any particular set of data, including mean/median/mode calculations, measuring variations/deviations, and understanding more macro level observations such as data skewness.
- Inferential statistics is concerned with the inference of larger trends about populations from the observations taken from smaller samples. For that reason it is important in inferential statistics to be certain that the sample represents the larger population perfectly; of course, we do not live in an ideal world and so no sample is a perfect representation of the population, thus we often utilize certain sampling techniques, and significance tests to make calculations in statistics more rigorous.

## Terminology & Notation
Before going further with elucidating any of the concepts relevant to both descriptive and inferential statistics, it is important to define the relevant terminology and notations.

### Sample Vs. Population
Statisticians dream of an experiment where their sample is the population, this is because despite the mathematical complexity we may often associate with statistics, it is really only so complex because of the issues faced when assuming that a sample of individuals or animals is a perfect representation of the whole population.

Since samples are in fact not perfect representations of the whole population, we must be very specific in our calculations to ensure that we always use proper notation.

The notations used in statistics are different depending on whether we are speaking about the sample or the population, the table below summarizes the different notations used for both samples and populations:

|                    | Sample Statistic                                                   | Population Parameter                                       |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Size               | $ \large{n} $                                                      | $ \large{N} $                                              |
| Mean               | $ \large{\overline{x} = \frac{\Sigma{x}}{n}} $                     | $ \large{\mu = \frac{\Sigma{X}}{N}} $                      |
| Variance           | $ \large{s^2 = \frac{\Sigma{(x-\overline{x})^2}}{n-1}} $           | $ \large{\sigma^2 = \frac{\Sigma{(X-\mu)^2}}{N}} $         |
| Standard Deviation | $ \large{s = \sqrt{s^2}} $                                         | $ \large{\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}} $                       |
| Proportion         | $ \large{\hat{p} = \frac{n \  of \  successes}{n \ of \ trials}} $ | $ \large{p = \frac{N \ of \ successes}{N \ of \ trials}} $ |

# The Big Guide to Data

| *The 'Rising Sun' war flag of the Imperial Japanese army; 16 rays emerge out of a central disc resembling the 'Sun'* |

The use of statistics in Japan was not widespread throughout much of the early 20th century, and during the Second World War as well, however that would all change with the establishment of the 'Quality Control Research Group' by the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers[^1].

Following the end of the Second World War and the adoption of the 1947 institution, the Japanese economy was capable of adapting itself to the new world in such a stunning fashion due to a multitude of reasons, one of these reasons included the statistical literacy rates amongst its populations, with anywhere from 92-99 percent of the Japanese working population having an elementary understanding of the 'Seven Basic Tools of Quality'[^2].

Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa recalled from past experience that the solution to 95 percent of any company's problems can be discovered using these seven simple, yet extremely powerful tools which he described. Some of these tools include the histogram, the scatter diagram, and flow charts. The fact that literacy in these elementary statistical techniques was so widespread amongst the general population of Japan following the war allowed for the Japanese industries and companies (such as Toyota and it's Production System[^3]) to operate to extremely high degrees of quality and efficiency, thus statistics played a key role in propelling the Japanese economy to its current gargantuan status.

It is these examples that help to show us the real and deterministic advantages we gain once we develop a better understanding of the field of statistics, thus let us discover the elementary statistical tools used in biostatistics, their characteristics, uses, and their overall contributions to the field of medicine.

## The Variable
There is nothing as elementary in statistics than understanding the variable. The variable can be thought of as any singular category which is observed and used to determine values that we can deduce observations from. Variables are mainly divided into two types: qualitative and quantitative variables.
- A qualitative variable is a variable which is measured in a discrete manner and is not numerical. Further sub-classifications include nominal (no particular order), binary (present/absent, agree/disagree), ordinal (has a natural order negative/neutral/positive), and counted variables (counted but non-quantitative variables).
- A quantitative variable is a variable which is physically measured and is a quantifiable value (i.e., can be expressed as a number). Quantitative variables can be interval (all real numbers used in measurement), or ratio variables (expressed as positive numbers, with 0 indicating none)

## The Six Basic Graphics of Biostatistics
Similarly to the 'Seven Basic Tools of Quality' described by Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa, within the field of biostatistics specifically there are six basic graphics that students must learn before attempting to learn any further concepts. These so called 'Six Basic Graphics of Biostatistics' are:

### Frequency Tables
A frequency table is a simple table that lists a variable and its value or the number of times it has occurred, they are often used in tallying. Below is a frequency table of pets in a hypothetical town.

| Pet               | Frequency (Number) |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Cats              | 23                 |
| Dogs              | 24                 |
| Peregrine Falcons | 1                  |

### Bar Charts

The bar chart is a chart with rectangular bars that display the values of certain variables through the proportions of their height and width relative to the axes around them.

### Contingency Tables

Contingency tables, also known as crosstabs, are a more complex frequency tables that take display multivariate frequency distributions of a particular variable. Contingency tables are most often used in scientific research since it helps us find relationships between two or more variables more easily. 

### Histograms

The histogram, first introduced by Karl Pearson, is a graphic used in the frequency distribution of quantitative data. It divides ranges of values into 'bins' of a certain size, and the values are then sorted into the bins to produce a frequency distribution.

The histogram is one of the more popular graphics because of how intuitive it is to use, as it allows us to understand certain features about data such as skewness, in addition to approximations of mean, median, and the mode within a particular set of values.

### Scatter Plots

| ![Enwiki.damaging_goodfaith.proba_scatter.svg/2560px-Enwiki.damaging_goodfaith.proba_scatter.svg.png](/assets/images/Enwiki.damaging_goodfaith.proba_scatter.svg.png) |

A scatter plot is a graphic used in statistics to plot points relevant to two different variables, the plotted points then form a 'scattered' pattern that shows the trends in the data. Scatter plots are often accompanied with correlation tests that determine a numerical value indicating the strength and directionality of the relationship between the two different variables.

### Box Plots

The box plot, or box-and-whisker diagram, is a graphic used in statistics and biostatistics to understand the distributions, locality, spread and skewness of data values for any variable. The box plot divides the data into quartiles that can then be used to further analyze the data, it is useful in many applications including but not limited to mean/median/mode calculations, skewness estimation, interquartile range calculation, determining maximum and minimum, finding percentiles, and determining outliers.

# Distributions: The Math
In the previous sections we discussed some of the mathematical notations, in addition to some important statistical values including the mean, median, mode, IQR, and more. This section aims at delving deeper into these different metrics and values for us to develop a better understanding of them, their uses, and how to derive them.
## Mean, Median, and Mode

Often times it is difficult to wrap our heads around large sets of data, for that reason, it is more often than not that we try to compensate for our perceptual limitations through the use of simplified representations of these large sets of data. The mean, median, and mode are three metrics first used during the process of descriptive statistics, together these three simple metrics allow us to understand two key aspects of any particular set of data, the shape (i.e., distribution or skewness), and the center of data.

<h4>Finding the Mean</h4>
The mean is the average of all the data values in the set, the median is the value that sits at the center of the data set once all the data is ordered, and the mode is the most commonly occurring value within the dataset. The formula for the mean is shown below:

$$ \large{\overline{x} = \frac{\Sigma^{n}_{i=1}x_i}{n}} $$

<h4> Finding the Median </h4>

| :--: |
| *How to find the median in both even and odd datasets. Blythwood, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0), via Wikimedia Commons* |

The mean as described earlier is simply the center value in any set of data, for odd datasets it is quite straightforward, however even datasets require averaging of the two center values before finding the median.

<h4> Finding the Mode </h4>

| *A histogram bimodal of the body lengths of a group of ants, it demonstrates a bimodal distribution. [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0), via Wikimedia Commons* |

The mode is the most common value in the dataset, and it helps us understand the number of peaks in a distribution, and in relation to the mean and the median it is even possible to estimate the skewness of the frequency distribution of the dataset.

## Spread

| :--: |
| The spread can differ even when the mean, median, and mode are the same. JRBrown, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons |

In descriptive statistics we use two main tools to measure the spread of data, the standard deviation ($s^2$) and the variance ($\sigma^2$). Two sets of data may sometimes share the same mean/median/mode however they can differ in the actual spread and so they will have different standard deviation and variance values.

The formula for calculating both variance and standard deviation are as shown above in [this table](#sample-vs-population), between the two measures the standard deviation is more commonly used since the variance is a quadratic unit.

## Skewness

The shape of a frequency distribution or a histogram can either be centered (unimodal or multimodal), left-skewed, right-skewed, asymmetrical multimodal, or uniform. Identifying if a frequency distribution is left-skewed or right-skewed can be counter-intuitive at times, for that reason it is helpful to imagine a uniform distribution without any skew; a single large slab like the dessert above, if you are to take a bite from the left half of the dessert, it will resemble a left-skewed distribution, if you fancy a bite from the right half then it will resemble a right-skewed distribution.

## Percentiles

Elaborating more on the previous section ["Box plots"](#box-plots), box plots help in dividing the data into four quartiles. The first quartile covers the data points that fall in the 0th-25th percentile, the second quartile covers the data point within the 25th-50th percentile, and likewise the third quartile covers the 50th-75th percentile, and the 4th percentile shows us the data points within the 75th-100th percentiles.

The uses of ordering data like this are that we can determine a few key properties of the dataset, the first being the range which is equal to the difference between the largest and smallest data points which lie on the ends of a box plot chart:

$$ Range=Maximum-Minimum $$

Another important metric that can be determined using quartiles when data is ordered is the interquartile range or IQR, to determine the IQR it is the difference between the third and first quartiles.

 $$ Q_1 \ is \ at \ position=n\times0.25 $$
 $$ Q_3 \ is \ at \ position=n\times0.75 $$
 $$ IQR=Q_3-Q_1 $$

Where $n$ is equal to the number of data points in the dataset

## Outlier

Using the $IQR$, $Q_3$, and $Q_1$ values that have been calculated, it is possible to determine any outliers to the data set using a very simple calculation. Outliers are determined as values which lie 1.5 times $IQR$ away from the any of $Q_1$ or $Q_3$.

 $$ Lower \ Limit=Q_1-1.5\times{IQR} $$
 $$ Upper \ Limit=Q_3+1.5\times{IQR} $$

Naturally the true definition of outlier is debated as there is no concrete way of really understanding what is or isn't an outlier in within any particular dataset, however this level of understanding is sufficient for more foundational statistical studies, however the [further readings](#references--further-readings) will contain additional information for those who are interested[^4].
