<p>T-lymphocytes aid in cell-mediated immunity</p>

<h1 id="maturation-of-t-lymphocytes">Maturation of T-lymphocytes:</h1>

<p>Due to the large number of possible antigens that the immune system may encounter at any point, there must be a system in place which ensures the adaptive immune system has access to T-cells which match any and all possible antigens it may encounter.</p>

<p>The number of T-cells with unique cell-surface receptors produced by the adaptive immune system is upwards of one billion, and that is done through a process of somatic recombination of a limited number of inherited gene segments. The issue with such a method is that T-cells which cannot recognize self cells can arise by chance (which can cause autoimmune diseases, and so there is a selection process which is done to ensure that only the use.</p>

<p>This process occurs as the T-cells travel from the cortex of the thymus to the medulla. The non-lymphoid cells of the thymus (including endothelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells) express high levels of both class I and class II MHCs displaying self antigens to the thymocytes (the name of immature T-cells) as they move through. This process results in two outcomes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Positive selection: The T-cell which binds weakly to any MHC-antigen complexes are stimulated to survive.</li>
  <li>Negative selection: The T-cell which does bind or binds too strongly to any of the MHC-antigen complexes undergoes apoptosis.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="activation-of-helper-t-cells">Activation of Helper T-cells:</h3>
<p>An APC presents class II MHC bound antigens and stimulates the Helper T-cell, the binding process causes the APC to begin releasing interleukins and the helper T-cell is also stimulated and secretes cytokines that activate additional macrophages and cytotoxic cells.</p>

<h3 id="activation-of-cytotoxic-t-lymphocytes">Activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes:</h3>
<p>The cytotoxic T-cells is activated by the helper T-cell and recognizes the infected or cancerous cells that have different cell-surface antigens (coupled with class I MHCs) than normal cells.</p>

<p>Once the activate (mature) cytotoxic T-cells encounters the specific target antigen-MHC complex. it binds to the infected cell and attacks it by secreting cytotoxic granules containing granzymes that kill the target cell.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-helper-t-lymphocytes">Types of helper T-lymphocytes:</h3>
<h4 id="type-1">Type 1:</h4>
<p>Type 1 helper T-cells are responsible mainly for the immune response during [[General structure of bacteria|bacterial]] infections. T-cells differentiate into them by the secretion of IL-12, and they in-turn secrete:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IL-2 is an autocrine growth factor for TH1 cells</li>
  <li>IFN-g inhibits TH2 proliferation, activates macrophages and stimulate B cells to secrete IgG antibodies that opsonize microbes for phagocytosis</li>
  <li>LT (Lymphotoxin) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) activate neutrophils and stimulate inflammation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="type-2">Type 2:</h4>
<p>Type 2 helper T-cells are responsible mainly for the immune response during parasitic infections (primarily by helminths). These cells differentiate in response to helminths and allergens and do not require any significant signaling by the innate immune response. Upon activation they secrete:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IL-4 antagonizes IFN-g effects, suppresses macrophage activation and acts on B cells to stimulate IgE antibodies which are important for allergic reactions. IL-4 is also an autocrine growth and differentiation cytokine for TH2 cells</li>
  <li>IL-10 inhibits IFN-g synthesis, suppresses macrophage activation</li>
  <li>IL-5 activates eosinophils, a response which is important for defense against helminthic infections</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="b-lymphocytes">B-lymphocytes:</h1>
<p>B-lymphocytes aid in humoral immunity.</p>

<h3 id="activation-of-b-lymphocytes">Activation of B-lymphocytes:</h3>
<p>B-cells can bind using their cell-surface receptors to bind to a matching antigen, once a match is found the cell then ingests the antigen via endocytosis, and process it to be combined with class II MHCs for presentation to helper T-cells with matching receptors.</p>

<p>Once the B-cell activates a T-cell successfully, the activated T-cell releases lymphokines and interleukins that transform the B cell into a plasma cell which secretes antibodies.</p>

<h2 id="proliferation-of-cells">Proliferation of cells:</h2>
<p>Both the T-cells and B-cells require two distinct extracellular signals for them to proliferate and differentiate into effector cells. These two signals are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The binding of the antigen to the antigen receptor, which specifies the target proteins.</li>
  <li>The second signal is more complex and is provided by molecules called costimulants. The best known costimulatory molecule is the B7 on APCs which binds to the CD28 molecule on the surface of the T-cells. This induces the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, stimulate the production of cytokines by the T-cells and induce proliferation and differentiation of the T-cell to deal with the target antigen.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="memory-of-the-immune-system">Memory of the immune system:</h1>
<p>Some of the activated B and T-cells remain after an immune response in the body as memory cells. These cells remain circulating in the blood and are able of mounting an immune response on a much larger and faster scale when an antigen is encountered again than it would be for a new antigen. Through these memory cells, “immunity” is acquired.</p>

<p>The two main types of immunity that can be acquired are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Long-term immunity; which is stimulated by direct infections and vaccinations.</li>
  <li>Short-term immunity; which is transferred passively from one individual to another via any antibody-containing serum. This is also seen in infants which receive antibodies that protect them throughout their infancy periods from diseases previously encountered by the mother of the child.</li>
</ol>
